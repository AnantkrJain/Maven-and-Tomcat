TOMCAT CLI :-

1. If another process is going on in tomcat default port and you want to run tomcat there,
		Find the process Id running on the port 8080
			netstat -ano | findstr "PID :8080"
		Kill the process so tomcat server can run on port 8080
			taskkill /pid [Process Id] /f
		#If access is denied to kill the particular process id, then run the command prompt as administrator.

2. Go to the location where tomcat is extracted. In my case, it is "C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\apache-tomcat-9.0.36\bin"

3. Use command "catalina.bat start". Tomcat will start running on port number 8080. Go to browser, provide URL: http://localhost:8080/.

4. On providing URL, it may ask for username and password. Then provide username and password in "[tomcat directory]/conf/tomcat-users.xml" as: 
	
	<tomcat-users>
		<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui,admin-script"/>
	</tomcat-users>

	3. Select Apache->Tomcat->Apache Tomcat v9.0 
		#Version should be same as downloaded tomcat server on your computer.

	4. Browse the location of tomcat server folder downloaded in your computer. 

	5. Now in "Servers" tab, you will get "Tomcat v9.0 Server at localhost [Stopped,Synchronized]"

	6. Start the server now. If it shows that port is busy, then kill the process id running on the port in command line(as instructerd in TOMCAT CLI).

	7. Now in "Servers" tab, you will get "Tomcat v9.0 Server at localhost [Started,Synchronized]". Also go to the browser and provide the URL: http://localhost/8080/.
	#If server is not started, then you will get the output as "This site can't be reached" otherwise you will get "HTTP Status 404 - Not Found".

Running two servers:-

Single instance of tomcat can have multiple number of ports but still you want to run two tomcat servers, then
copy the tomcat directory into another location. Now you have two locations for tomcat server.

Go to one of the locations: [Tomcat directory]->conf->server.xml. Change the port number 8080 to something else. Now, default port number is changed for one of the tomcat servers. 

	To change the port number of tomcat server in command line, use "catalina.bat start -port.number=[Port Number]" command.
